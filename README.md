# Dynamic Table & Popover Control System

This project demonstrates a dynamic, reusable control system for managing entities (currently **Projects**). The system is built using Next.js, Prisma, Zustand, and a collection of shadcn/ui components. It’s designed to be modular so that the same table, action popover, and form logic can be reused for other entity types (e.g., Tasks, Objectives) with minimal changes.

---

## Overview

The dynamic system is composed of the following parts:

1. **API Routes (Next.js Server Routes)**  
   The API endpoints (under `app/api/projects/`) handle CRUD operations for projects. They use Prisma to interact with a PostgreSQL database, with a similar folder structure and logic as was used for objectives.

2. **State Management (Zustand)**  
   The project state is managed by a dedicated Zustand store (`store/projectStore.ts`). This store:
   - Fetches data from the API.
   - Provides methods for adding, updating, and deleting projects.
   - Maintains a global state (`projects`, `isLoading`, `error`) that is used across components.

3. **Reusable UI Components**  
   The UI is built with a set of reusable components:
   - **BaseTable:** A dynamic table component (`components/BaseTableSystem/BaseTable.tsx`) that renders columns, rows, and actions for any entity.
   - **Action Popover:** A popover component integrated within the table that displays available actions (e.g., modify, mark in progress, delete).
   - **Date Selector:** A component that allows enabling/disabling and selecting dates in forms.
   - **UI Primitives:** Custom buttons, cards, dialogs, inputs, and labels are used (all found in `components/ui/`).

4. **Entity-Specific Table Component**  
   A minimal table view (for example, `components/ProjectTable/ProjectTable.tsx`) wraps the `BaseTable` for projects. This file:
   - Configures columns specific to projects.
   - Provides action definitions (modify, mark in progress, mark complete, delete) that invoke corresponding methods in the Zustand store.
   - Supplies default new item data for the “Add New” functionality.

5. **Main Page**  
   The main page (found in `app/page.tsx`) is kept intentionally short. It simply imports and renders the entity-specific table (in this case, the **ProjectTable**). This ensures that your page remains uncluttered and focuses on displaying the table with minimal boilerplate.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching & State Updates:**  
   When the Projects page mounts, the `useProjectStore` fetches the latest projects from the API. The store then updates its state, which in turn causes the `ProjectTable` to re-render with the latest data.

2. **Dynamic Table Rendering:**  
   The `BaseTable` component receives:
   - **Data:** An array of projects.
   - **Columns:** A configuration array that specifies which properties to display.
   - **Actions:** A list of actions (e.g., Modify, Delete) to be rendered in a popover on each row.
   - **New Item Handling:** A default new item template and a callback for adding new items.
   
   The table automatically formats cells, supports custom cell renderers, and handles the display of dates and enum values.

3. **Inline Modifications:**  
   When a user clicks on an action (such as “Modify” or “Delete”), the action popover appears. This popover provides inline dialogs for updating or confirming deletion. Once an action is confirmed, the corresponding method from the store is called to update the backend via the API and then refresh the state.

4. **Reusability & Extensibility:**  
   Because the system is built around generic types (using TypeScript generics) and a modular component architecture, it’s straightforward to adapt the same system to handle other entity types (like tasks or objectives). Simply create new types, store logic, and a table configuration component that reuses `BaseTable`.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**  
   Make sure you have all dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Database Setup:**  
   Update your `.env` file with the correct `DATABASE_URL` and run Prisma migrations:
   ```bash
   pnpm prisma migrate dev --name add_projects
   ```

3. **Development:**  
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Testing CRUD Operations:**  
   - **Fetch Projects:** The main page automatically loads projects on mount.
   - **Add New Project:** Click the “Add New” button to open a dialog and enter details.
   - **Modify or Delete:** Use the action popover on each project row to modify or delete entries.

---

## Future Extensions

- **Generic Entity Handling:**  
  Rename or refactor the system (e.g., `tablePopoverControlGroup`) to handle multiple entity types by parameterizing the BaseTable and store logic further.

- **Additional Features:**  
  You can extend the system with filters, sorting, pagination, and more advanced inline editing capabilities.

---

## Conclusion

This dynamic control system offers a scalable, reusable solution for managing project data (or any entity) with a clean, modular architecture. By centralizing common logic in the BaseTable and using a consistent state management pattern with Zustand, this approach keeps both the codebase and UI lean, maintainable, and ready for future expansion.
